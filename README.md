# giac_index
Simple for formatting large .tsv files to docx in a pretty format

<h3>Reqs </h3>

Must install python-dox library


<h3>Expected Data Format </h3>
The script is written for data in the following format: 

'Term' , 'Book,Page #' , 'Description' 

Name your .tsv file 'index1.tsv' and place it into the same dir as this script and it will output a docx file named 'index_finalized.docx'


ps - this code could be optimized but it gets the job done if you have a 600+ item index 🤷🏻‍♀️
